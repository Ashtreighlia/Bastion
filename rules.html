    <h2 id="overlook">Quick Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In Bastion, you build a compact yet powerful 50-card deck accompanied by
      a champion, relic, and pact, which reside in the Bastion. These special
      spells allow you to tailor your deck towards a specific strategy and
      provide unique tactical options. The game is designed to be a fast-paced
      experience, with a focus on the interplay between your bastion spells and
      your deck.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Bastion">Bastion Mechanics</h2>
    <p>
      The Bastion is a special zone aside from your deck that houses your
      Champion, Relic, and Pact. These spells are not directly part of your
      library but are instead available to you from the start of the game.
      Through casting your Bastion spells, you can shape the course of the
      battle and gain a strategic edge over your opponent. However, each time a
      Bastion piece is cast from the Bastion, their costs increase, forcing you
      to carefully consider the timing and order of your plays in order to
      maximize their impact.
    </p>

    <h3>Bastion Pieces</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Champion:</strong> A legendary creature that leads your deck
        into battle, allowing you to build around its unique abilities or use it
        as a standalone threat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Relic:</strong> An artifact that supports your deck with its passive
        effects or activated abilities, synergizing with your deck.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pact:</strong> An enchantment that offers a powerful effect or
        ongoing advantage, shaping the battlefield to your advantage.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your Relic and Pact may also be creatures.
    </p>

    <h3>Unified Tax</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Starting Tax:</strong> The unified tax for casting Bastion
        spells from the Bastion starts out at 0.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Casting from Bastion:</strong> When you decide to cast your
        Champion, Relic, or Pact from the Bastion, you must pay its base cost
        and additionally the current unified tax (as colorless mana).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tax Increase:</strong> Each time any of your Bastion spells
        leave the Bastion, the unified tax increases by 1 for all future casts.
        This cumulative tax forces you to think carefully about the order and
        timing of your plays.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Tax Example</h4>
    <p>
      Let's assume you cast your Champion first. As the current tax is 0, you
      only pay its base cost, and increase the tax to 1. The next time you cast
      any Bastion spell - be it your Relic or Pact - you'll need to pay its base
      cost plus 1, then the tax increases to 2 for the subsequent cast.
      This incremental cost continues to rise with each cast from the Bastion,
      ensuring that even low-cost spells must be cast with care.
    </p>

    <h3>Recasting</h3>
    <p>
      If your Champion, Relic, or Pact would be put into the graveyard or be
      exiled, you may instead choose to return it to the Bastion. This allows
      you to recast your Bastion spells, but at an increased cost due to the
      unified tax.
    </p>

    <h2 id="construction">Deck Construction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Deck Size:</strong> Your deck consists of 50 cards (singleton,
        aside from basic lands), including the Bastion spells.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Color Identity:</strong> The color identity of your deck is
        determined by the combined color identities of your Champion, Relic, and
        Pact. Every card in your deck must conform to this union.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="rules">To Long Didn't Read</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Deck Size:</strong> Your deck consists of 50 cards, including
        the Bastion spells.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Color Identity:</strong> Your deck's color identity is
        determined by the combined color identities of your Champion, Relic, and
        Pact.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bastion:</strong> Your Champion (legendary creature), Relic
        (artifact), and Pact (enchantment) all start the game in the Bastion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unified Tax:</strong> Every time a spell is cast
        from the Bastion, the unified tax increases by 1 for all subsequent
        casts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Recasting:</strong> If your Bastion spells would be put
        into the graveyard or be exiled, you may instead return them to the
        Bastion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Starting Life:</strong> Each player begins the game with 20
        life.
      </li>
    </ul>
